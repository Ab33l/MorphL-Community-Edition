# What is MorphL

MorphL is an open-source initiative that uses machine learning to predict users' behavior in mobile & web applications and enable personalized user experiences to increase engagement & conversion rates.

Morphl.io is funded through [Google Digital News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/dnifund/) (€ 50,000 grant).


The product development process usually consists of a few important phases: <strong>planning</strong>, <strong>design</strong>, <strong>development</strong> and <strong>launch</strong>. To increase engagement and conversion rates, this process undergoes multiple iterations which developers seldom navigate by looking at the data. Usually there’s somebody else, be it a product owner, marketing or sales person, analyzing it and feeding developers a feature list needed for the next product release. 

There lies the gap between developers, marketers and users which leads to lots of guess-work. Consequently, the product development feedback loop is broken. 

MorphL uses machine learning to optimize user interactions by analyzing product micro-metrics and enabling automatic user interface adaptation to provide a personalized user experience.


# How it works

- [x] <strong>Morphl Integrations</strong>
We integrate with Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, Mixpanel, Kissmetrics and other platforms to identify user behaviors. <br/><br/>

- [x] <strong>Morphl Predictive Models</strong>
We're utilizing open-source machine learning algorithms to build predictive models which are then used to develop predictive applications.<br/><br/>

- [x] <strong>Morphl Personalized Experience</strong>
Developers can integrate micro-metrics directly in the user-facing product components and use the MorphL insights to build personalized user experiences.
