# What is MorphL

MorphL is an open-source initiative that uses machine learning to predict users' behavior in mobile & web applications and enable personalized user experiences to increase engagement & conversion rates. Morphl.io is funded through [Google Digital News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/dnifund/) (€ 50,000 grant).

The product development process usually consists of a few important phases: <strong>planning</strong>, <strong>design</strong>, <strong>development</strong> and <strong>launch</strong>. To increase engagement and conversion rates, this process undergoes multiple iterations which developers seldom navigate by looking at the data. Usually there’s somebody else, be it a product owner, marketing or sales person, analyzing it and feeding developers a feature list needed for the next product release. 

There lies the gap between developers, marketers and users which leads to lots of guess-work. Consequently, the product development feedback loop is broken. 

MorphL uses machine learning to optimize user interactions by <strong>analyzing product micro-metrics</strong> and enabling automatic user interface adaptation to provide a <strong>personalized user experience</strong>.
